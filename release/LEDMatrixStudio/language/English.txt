Single colour. Pixels can be on or off. This mode is ideal for all single colour LED matrix displays.
Bi-colour (sequential). Pixels can be one of three colours (and off). This mode is ideal for all bi-colour LED matrix displays, or those that use two LEDs per pixel. Data is output in sequence (pixel 1, pixel 2, etc..).
Bi-colour (bitplanes). Pixels can be one of three colours (and off). This mode is ideal for all bi-colour LED matrix displays, or those that use two LEDs per pixel. Data is output in planes (pixel 1 LED 1, pixel 2 LED 1... pixel 1 LED 2, pixel 2 LED 2, ...).
RGB. Pixels can be any colour from a 24 bit RGB palette. Use this mode with any RGB pixel device. Uses 4 bytes per pixel to store data (unoptimised).
RGB 3BPP. Limited RGB mode where each pixel is represened by only 3 bits, giving 7 colours (+ off). This mode uses much less space than full RGB mode. Use it with tri-colour LED displays or for RGB panels where ROM storage is limited.
